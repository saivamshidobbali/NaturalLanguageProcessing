We've provided two sets of sample files.

a) train1.txt and test1.txt are tiny, so you can use these files to get
intuition about what your system should do. The correct output file is
ngrams-test1.trace.

b) train2.txt and test2.txt are more typical examples of a text
corpus and sample sentences. The correct output file is
ngrams-test2.trace.

We also provided a sample seeds file (seeds.txt) and output file
(ngrams-gen.trace) for the -gen option for the additional generation
task for cs6340 students.  Of course, since this component involves
random number generation, do not expect your results to exactly match
ours! But you can use this trace file to see the correct formatting
and get a general idea of how your system should behave.

Good luck!
